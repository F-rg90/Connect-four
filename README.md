# Connect-four

4:56am

Welcome to Quattro!

Quattro is quite simple, Beat your opponent by connecting your piece 4 times in a row. Similar to Connect four, but in Spanish!

Player 1 goes first, then player 2. Be Strategic! Plan ahead and set pieces up in order to stay ahead of your opponent! 

Pieces can be connected Horizontally, Vertically or diagonally! 

thank you internet and google for helping achieve this. 
without you, all id have is a blank page with some CSS and HTML and the little my brain had from absorbing my Professors lectures.

plz grant me sleep, this week sucked.
